# This is my first project on Git

## I will use MarkDown language to make it more clear.

1. First of all we need to install Git and Visual Studio Console correctly

2. Then we should make a repositary (using command *"git init"*)
3. When Git initialize our folder as a repositary, we can add any files (i. e., as this one was added)
4. After that we commit all new changes.
5. And at the end - push changed files directly to Git repositary

# X, Y, Z - Now we know ALPHABETE!
